# too much time to get the information or the section?

# maybe wrong and not intuitive name
    # the folder name must describe the inside
        # i.e. "needs" was too poor to describe the content where I had all the maslow needs
        #Â so renaming "MASLOW_needs" helped me
        # cause in my mind, while I was trying to get that info
        # I was repeating "where did I put maslow needs?"

# maybe it's not well organized
    # 
# maybe it's not well designed
    # threejs  - a 3D form is better?
