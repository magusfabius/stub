Etymology
Unknown. Attested since 1951 as US student slang.

Perhaps an alteration of nerts (“nuts", "crazy”); see references below.
The word, capitalized, appeared in 1950 in Dr. Seuss’s If I Ran the Zoo as the name of an imaginary animal:
And then, just to show them, I’ll sail to Katroo / And bring back an It-Kutch, a Preep and a Proo, / A Nerkle, a Nerd and a Seersucker too!
Various unlikely folk etymologies and less likely backronymic speculations also exist.
