# Freedom is more important than Love
# freedom inside the relationship ... i.e. E.W. conversation
#      I don't feel guilty
#      I feel free to hang up

# when you are in love
# everyone has a different definition of love
# everyone feel something different
# in this society we are scared to stay alone
# the main narrative is the ONE LOVE with ONE PERSON
# but it does not work like this (not to me at least)
# but it hasn't always worked like this
# Harari
# BLINDNESS
# it won't last forever ...
