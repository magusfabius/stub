Often I'm asked, which Shakespeare play have I seen most often? The answer has more to do with prevalence of a play's production than my own personal favorites, because I will see any Shakespeare production I can get to. Thus, the following list isn't ranked according to my personal preferences but the general public's preferences (or, at least, those of theater impresarios). This list is only stage productions, not films or television broadcasts, but in the case of a tie I consider screen versions I've seen as a tiebreaker.

The order of this list will alter over time, I'm sure. Number of productions seen per play is in parenthesis.
