ACT in a Nutshell
My own personal style for both coaching and therapy is what I call ‘ACT Made Simple’ – it is a distilled, simplified version of ACT, influenced very strongly by three factors:

1) the work of Kirk Strosahl, one of the originators of ACT, renowned for the simplicity, rapidity, and effectiveness of his interventions,

2) my previous training in solution-oriented counselling and other brief therapies, much of which can be adapted to fit this model, and

3) most of all, by my own personal motto: ‘Simplicity, Clarity, Accessibility’. ACT has been around since the mid-eighties, so it comes with quite an amazing heritage of tools, techniques, interventions and strategies. However, some of these are unnecessarily complex or longwinded. I have made it my personal mission to modify, adapt or reinvent tools, techniques, and training methods wherever possible, in order to make ACT readily accessible to everyone and anyone – whether they are a health professional, therapist, coach, student, client, patient – or simply an interested member of the general public.

My personal preference in ACT is to work quickly and effectively, and as a result, the vast majority of my work would fall under categories b), c), and d) above. However, I do have a few long-term clients with multiple severe problems, that I have been seeing for several years. And this is one of the many things I love about the ACT model: its flexibility. I love the way it can so readily be adapted, and made as short or long as it needs to be, to suit the individual needs of the client, group, or organisation.
