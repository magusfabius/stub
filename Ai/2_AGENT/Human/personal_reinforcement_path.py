# you are doing good if

# writing about my ideas
# create videogames where I try to describe how the world would like to me

# accetta i tuoi limiti fabio
# non sei fatto per specificarti in qualcosa
# la tua forza è la fantasia, la creatività
# dare idee e spunti più che realizzarli
# e se un'AI può fare tutto allora ti rimane
# la collaborazione a livello di idee 


# everything on cloud
# PWA -> a game as a website
# blockchain -> NFT
# AI
# educational + simulation of my life
# would you like to do that .... simulate it!
# 

# remember to 
# ask nature
# look to fire -> 

# fantasies that can unify ppl from all over the world
# dying humans, asteroid, suffer, injustice
# when you don't care about other? 
# lack of empathy
# human cases 
# would you like to live in a universe like that

# unify good and bad 
# when evil and good meet

# I should eat a piadina - MASLOW 0 example

# I should eat
# Why you should take a piadina and not a vegetable?
# What?

# why? -> beacuse I'm hungry -> hungry is the key that make me understand we are in maslow 0, so it has a high priority but a low score
# so? -> What's the action you can do in order to solve this need? -> suggested ACTIONs: buy a piadina, cook, 
# Action payload (cons):
    # buy a piadina, payload: spend money
    # cook: spend time




# is the ACTION possible? 
# if no -> what are the obstacles?
    # not in the right context -> so reach a right context
    # right context but no money -> how can you get money
    # right context but bad personal status -> why bad personal status?

# if yes -> do it 
    # action is finished
    # how much are you satisfied of this action? 1-100
    # personal satisfaction threshold
    # 


# get common patterns
# you know it's a high percentage that once you finished eating you will smoke (90% score) - you did it



# CONFUSION -> get priority tensor



# I should make money -> why? 
#                          -> survive in society -> why? -> MASLOW 0
#                          -> be recognized -> why? -> MASLOW 1
