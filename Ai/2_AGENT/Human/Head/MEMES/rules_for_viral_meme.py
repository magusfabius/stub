WHERE DOES RULES OF THE INTERNET COME FROM?

Contrary to what the name may imply, the so-called rules of the internet are not laws enforceable by any official authority. Rather, they are a series of in-jokes, guidelines, and references related to internet culture as it was in the early 2000s. Many of the catchphrases within the rules of the internet, as it exists today, are specific allusions to memes on 4chan or popular references to Fight Club, South Park, and so on.

Emerging as a kind of Netiquette for the Internet group Anonymous, the rules of the internet were published on the satirical wiki, Encyclopedia Dramatica, in 2006, before an attempt at a more official list emerged on 4chan in 2007. The founder of 4chan, Christopher Poole, has said that the rules became so popular that users tended to ignore 4chan’s rules in favor of their own homemade rules of the internet.

There’s no one, consistent, agreed-upon set of rules of the internet. The original list claimed, for instance, to have 50 rules, but actually only had 18. Some later versions have only 48 entries, whereas others have 100. While the rules vary quite a bit across online subcultures, a few have become well established, including a number of holdovers from the original Encyclopedia Dramatica:

Rule 1: Do not talk about rules 2-33
Rule 34: There is porn of it. No exceptions.
Rule 35: The exception to rule #34 is the citation of rule #34.
Rule 36: Anonymous does not forgive.
Rule 37: There are no girls on the internet.
Rule 38: A cat is fine too
Rule 39: One cat leads to another.
Rule 40: Another cat leads to zippocat.
Rule 41: Everything is someone’s sexual fetish.
Rule 42: It is delicious cake. You must eat it.
Rule 43: It is a delicious trap. You must hit it.
Rule 44: /b/ sucks today.
Rule 45: Cock goes in here.
Rule 46: They will not bring back Snacks.
Rule 47: You will never have sex.
Rule 48: ???
Rule 49: Profit.
Rule 50: You can not divide by zero.

Whatever the particular list, the rules of the internet are intended to be funny, and many rules purposely contradict each other. Rule 34, for example, refers to the ubiquity of pornography online: “There is porn of it. No exceptions.” Then, Rule 35 follows up: “The exception to rule #34 is the citation of rule #34.”

Other rules of the internet are misogynistic or provocative in nature. Rule 30 (in some versions), for instance, declares: “There are no girls on the internet.” as if to claim the internet as an exclusively male space. And Rule 31 demands: “Tits or GTFO,” or “Show me a picture of your tits or get the fuck out,” said to female users in online forums.

The early rules of the internet reflected the nature of 4chan at the time: raw, new, anonymous, and widely used by younger males with nerdy interests, like anime and gaming. As the internet expanded and evolved, the rules of internet evolved with it, leading some users to think the rules are dramatically out of date.
