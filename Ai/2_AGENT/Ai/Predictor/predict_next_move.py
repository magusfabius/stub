"""
just imagine a real world GTA, you completed all the mission, you win against every player
then what you wanna do?
you wanna enter god_mode
being able to predict what other players will do
being aware of everything
especially the nature of the game, the code
get the easter eggs

while sitting in front of your pc
or just in your mind

you can go on mars with a tesla bot
you can access the cameras of the world




Over the last years scientists have come to realize 
that the brain is a predictive machine. 
It produces a model of the world
and continuously predicts what will happen next.

When our brainâ€™s predictions are not correct, 
we realize that something is not right
 and our brain updates its model of the world. 
 As time goes on, our model of the world gets richer 
 and more sophisticated.


 Jeff Hawkins points out that our brain learns
  a model of the world by paying attention to 
  how the inputs it receives change as we move 
  (or as those inputs move).
