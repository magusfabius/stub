theory_1 = "The relation with DMT. In the first season, Riley was smoking DMT when she first had her sesate experience. Also when puck was breaking down the blocker he made the comment of it being the exact opposite of DMT. DMT for those who dont know is a fascinating drug. Many user say it was life changing. Its a chemical that can be found in our own brains and even some plants. Some call it the spirit molecule. And if smoked can cause hallucinations and a feeling of connection tonall living things. My theory is that DMT strengthens the sensate ability or has a direct effect on it. It may even be apart if the birthy process for cluster. Since sesates are a different species from human i feel like they have an 'abundance' of DMT in thier biology."
